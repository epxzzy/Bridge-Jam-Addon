# The Void Awakening(ARCHIVED)
This Was *Our* Submission For The [bridge. Add-On Jam](https://github.com/bridge-core/bridge-jam). 

## Description
The Void Has Awakened, And it Wishes to Conquer The Overworld By Sending Troops to it. Ancient Portals Appear Everywhere, Snd Only You Can Stop Them.
Kill The Voidmen, Close Their Portals, And Defeat The Void Herald!

## Theme Reasoning on 'THE WORLD IS YOUR ENEMY'
We Thought About It For About 2-3 hours, And We Came To The Conclusion of: "what if it isn't the minecraft world, but another dimension?" And We Ended up Creating This "dimension" Which is Not Actually Explorable, Mobs That Come From That Dimension Wish to Destroy The Overworld Thus Becoming Your Enemy.
